    <h3>Education</h3>
       <p><b>Master of Library and Information Science</b><br>Florida State University (2021)<br>
        <br>
    <b>Certificate of Information Architecture</b><br>Florida State University (2021)<br>
        <br>
    <b>Bachelor of Arts in Editing, Writing & Media w/ a Philosophy Minor</b><br>Florida State University (2017)<br></p>
      
      <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
    <h4><b>University of Alabama at Birmingham Libraries</b><br><i>Electronic Access & Discovery Librarian</i><br>06/2022-PRESENT<br>Birmingham, AL</h4>
    
      <p>In my current role at UAB Libraries, I regularly support diverse user groups (faculty, students, medical practitioners, and researchers) across five campus library locations, including medical and historical libraries. I implement, maintain, and enhance a wide range of library technologies and systems to ensure seamless access to digital and electronic resources and services for the library community.</p>
      
      <p>Additionally, I collect and analyze resource and platform usage data using Oracle Analytics, Google Analytics, vendor platforms, Tableau, and Excel to inform decision-making and improve services. I ensure uninterrupted access to the library’s extensive electronic and digital holdings using knowledge of EZproxy, OpenURL mapping, parse parameter linking, metadata standards, LibKey, Shibboleth, and two-factor authentication (2FA), while also supporting digital collections resource sharing with partner institutions.</p>

      <p>I collaborate with Subject Specialists on instructional design initiatives and develop instructional materials and workshops to promote platform and system literacy across departments. I align my work, special projects, and professional development with the library’s strategic goals and service mission.</p>
      
      <p>I work in a team environment to manage systems such as Ex Libris Alma, Primo VE, OCLC WMS, EZproxy, Shibboleth, Digital Commons, Library Mobile, and Springshare LibApps. To stay current in the evolving field of library technology and access services, I actively participate in professional development and scholarly engagement at local and national levels.</p>
    
    <h4><b>Florida State University Libraries</b><br><i>Electronic Resources Library Associate</i><br>06/2019-06/2022<br>Tallahassee, FL</h4>
      
      <p>At FSU Libraries, I led the implementation and customization of the institution’s CORAL Electronic Resource Management System (ERMS), building out key modules such as Licensing, Organizations, Usage Data, Resources, and Management. I developed workflows and best practices for using CORAL, enhancing coordination in vendor relationships, licensing, and access. I also created documentation and workflows for managing and maintaining e-resource collections in EBSCOadmin.</p>
      
      <p>My role involved extensive collaboration with FSU’s global library network including consortium partners, vendors, and publishers, while providing ongoing support and troubleshooting to ensure uninterrupted access to databases, journals, e-books, and digital media. This required me to apply technical expertise in EZproxy, OpenURL mapping, parse parameter linking, and metadata standards. To support evidence-based collection development, I regularly collected and analyzed usage statistics from multiple vendor platforms and the library's internal systems.</p>
      
      <p> I contributed to the Libraries’ UX/UI committee to promote user-centered design for the website and discovery systems using software and products such as Google Analytics, Drupal 9, Morae, LucidChart, and OptimalWorkshop.</p>
      
      <p>During my time, I demonstrated skills in systems management, research support, vendor coordination, compliance, data analytics, and instructional documentation.</p>
    
    <h4><b>State Library of Florida, Bureau of Library and Information Services</b><br><i>Information Specialist III</i><br>
    10/2018-06/2019<br>Tallahassee, FL</h4>
 
      <p>At the State Library of Florida, I managed the electronic delivery service of library resources exclusively for State employees, coordinating digital access requests to ensure timely, reliable support for government operations and research needs. I also assisted with reviewing and renewing annual serial subscription contracts by evaluating usage trends and vendor terms to support cost-effective collection development.</p>

      <p>In addition to these responsibilities, I provided daily in-person and online reference services, helping patrons navigate resources and databases to find accurate information. I contributed to digitization efforts by uploading heavily used serials and periodicals to the State Library catalog and the Internet Archive, improving long-term accessibility and preservation of important government and public records.</p>

    <h4><b>Florida State University Libraries</b><br><i>Library Assistant</i><br>
    08/2015-08/2017<br>Tallahassee, FL</h4>
      
      <p>In this public service role, I provided daily in-person reference assistance, helping patrons locate materials, navigate collections, and answer research questions. I also trained users on specialized equipment like microfilm and microfiche scanners and supported them with computer applications and library software to facilitate their research and document needs.</p>

      <p>Beyond direct patron support, I volunteered for library events and presentations to enhance community engagement and promote library services. Additionally, I managed the check-in and check-out of physical inter-library loan materials and collected usage data to support internal reporting and resource planning.</p>
