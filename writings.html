<h3 id="toc1">Internet of Things: A connected world</h3>
<p>
At least a decade ago the very idea of having every device and object connected seemed far-fetched. As technology continues to advance and we become more accustomed to the rapid changes, this idea grows less and less extraordinary for common folks. For the most part many modern devices and objects are already connected through advancements in network connectivity and the web. The “Internet of Things” (IoT) pushes the idea of connectivity to an even grander scale, to where many scientists, organizations and individuals are starting to recognize the benefits that a connected world would carry.<br>
<br>
Internet of Things is a combined network of devices and objects that connect and transfer data through the Internet without human interaction or interference and is often related to cloud computing and wireless transmission. A thing of the Internet can essentially be any kind of physical object, mechanical, or otherwise - if the object can be hooked up to an internet connection, then it is a thing of the Internet. There are numerous examples of how these objects may function depending on how they are set up. A common example might be a watch that is able to pick up and track personal information, such as heart rate and step counting, based on the data input received from sensors embedded in the device. This personal data is then stored and connected to other devices or accounts using a wireless network. Even something as simple as a pet’s toy could become a thing of the Internet, as long as the functional equipment is attached to the physical object. Special sensors and a network connection allow the object to transfer any collected data. The watch and the pet’s toy could effectively communicate and exchange data without ever consulting a human. The possibilities are limitless and will be explored more later in this paper.<br>
<br>
The architecture of the Internet of Things is what allows it to connect and function on such a potentially large scale. As detailed in the article “A Survey on Internet of Things Architecture, Protocols, Possible Applications, Security, Privacy, Real-World Implementation and Future Trends” by Panwit Tuwanut and Surapon Kraijak, there are multiple layers to its functionality. The Perception layer is the first layer which consists of various sensor devices that gather environmental information that can then be transmitted through the second layer, the Network later (Tuwanut and Kraijak). This next layer securely transfers information to the central information processing system. The Middleware layer provides service management as well as store information into a database (Tuwanut and Kraijak). The Application layer then takes the processed information from the Middleware layer to manage device applications (Tuwanut and Kraijak). Developers and organizations can take the combined information and process it from each aspect of the IoT makeup to create representational reports of the collected data to enhance business functions and decisions.<br>
<br>
However complex and numbered the layers of IoT are, it is still vulnerable and prone to complications and concerns, such as cyber-attacks, hacking and other software corruption methods. The electronic sensors within the devices can be hacked and reprogrammed, allowing hackers to eavesdrop on users, access data and create denial of service attacks, where an individual computer/system blocks a service for another system. The Network manages communication between devices and other networks, so DoS and DDoS are also a concern (Tuwanut and Kraijak). DDoS attacks are potentially even more dangerous as the attacks use multiple systems to overrun or corrupt a single system for a longer period, causing more damage. Among security issues, there are also privacy challenges as sensitive data from individual and connected devices can be taken from outside parties, like passwords for personal accounts, accessible files, or location tracking information. User data is automatically generated within wireless and cloud networks so anything within that network can be violated.<br>
<br>
Solutions for these issues range in scope and practice. For the most part, encryption with secure communication protocols and a dependable back-end security framework can assist in maintaining a secure system, whereas data protection services and secure user authorization allows for user information storage protection (Tuwanut and Kraijak). Two-factor authorization is a growing trend in security practices, where users gain access to personal accounts and data through multiple, verified logins using two different personal devices. For example, if a user is attempting to gain access to an account on one device, a laptop computer, they would have to accept the login from their phone, further verifying identity. Encryption services and security requirements would be maintained and updated regularly based on security needs by the organization or business itself. Even though lack of human interference is the goal and intention of IoT, system maintenance and device updates are still necessary like any other computing system.<br>
<br>
The unknown usage and eavesdropping of users’ data is a popular topic today and not only concerns outside hackers, but also extends to the developers of electronic devices and networks themselves. Analyzing data information from consumers is a common business practice that companies adhere to in order to grow and compete in their business market, but to what extent should they be allowed to use consumer data if it is not publicly known or made aware? If the Internet of Things has the capability to reach millions upon millions of user information and grow upon that information, this question would affect entire populations. Users may not think about their data outputs everyday necessarily, especially if the products or devices are routine essentials, but it brings into question what privacy actually means and the role of organizations in respecting their consumers within their business model. The Cambridge Dictionary defines privacy as “someone's right to keep their personal matters and relationships secret,” or to themselves. It’s not whether people are directly aware or care about their privacy actively, but rather it is about their right to care or not care. Manipulative and targeted marketing techniques are often used to reach and reel in consumers unfortunately. Secretive data gathering practices are sometimes a part of this process, but one idea behind privacy rights is to create a lasting, trusting user base through law and respect. Solid, upfront privacy practices and a positive use of the connectedness that the Internet of Things has to offer for organizations will create a strong consumer relationship. Privacy policy must be a factor in facilitating this ethical privacy environment.<br>
<br>
In a survey conducted in 2010 that analyzed global and cultural concerns on information privacy and privacy policies within different countries, research showed that despite cultural and governmental background differences among populations, privacy policy and business practices were still ranked as an importance for participants locally when brought to attention (Bellman, Steven et al). The most important aspect of this study highlighted those participants “from countries with no privacy regulation were more concerned about errors in databases [containing their information] compared with participants from countries with sectoral privacy regulation”, where cultural background didn’t play as much of an influence on opinions as previously thought (Bellman, Steven et al). When there was no regulation toward a population’s privacy, there was an increase in individual concern for this right. While there are overlapping inconsistencies and discrepancies within sectoral privacy regulation that is used within the United States, Bellman and other colleagues of this study point out the simple idea that organizations would benefit from forming privacy policy that relates to their users, especially as markets continue to expand internationally through advancement in web communications (Bellman, Steven et al).<br>
<br>
Trust is key to the use of IoT within organizations not only due to privacy rights, but also when it comes to consumer use of devices and things of the Internet. For instance, if one conducts a survey asking individuals what they think of autonomous vehicles and transportation piloted through wireless technologies, chances are people will be skeptical or concerned for their safety. Seeing a vehicle drive around without a driver, or being in the backseat of one, isn’t exactly an everyday occurrence for most. IoT and autonomous driving remains a developing technology. However, trust from consumers and the benefits of IoT implementation across the field of transportation assistance allows for safer and more efficient traveling, more eco-friendly fuel emission levels and smarter roadway development plans using consumer behavior data (Devi and Rukmini).<br>
<br>
For transportation services already using IoT, a wireless connection and sensors within the vehicles allow them to communicate and share information instantaneously in order to ensure a safe transportation pathway by directing the vehicles on where to go. If more vehicles were to use this technology, and traffic data between vehicles in real-time was shared, then congestion on interstates and other roads could be avoided. Vehicles would be instructed on appropriate speed limits that assist in user fuel cost and lower emission rates through more efficient engine propulsion. The traffic behavior data that travels throughout the IoT’s communication networks can be used to plan intersections that cause less frequent stops. As a result, traffic congestion would reduce by coordinating vehicle direction, which in-turn reduces fuel intake. Vehicles using the technology use less gas and energy when travelling at consistent, median speed limits. Cities like Singapore, who have announced their plan to implement driverless public transit in 2022, are already paving the way for the future of automation and concern for our environment (Williams, Rhiannon).<br>
<br>
Companies such as INRIX are putting IoT into use to benefit city traffic and provide insight into consumer behavior for further advancement on autonomous driving and traffic control. INRIX uses IoT to manage traffic by analyzing data from road sensors while transforming the way we think about transportation, travel and methods used for managing traffic safety (Inrix). INRIX states on their company website that they deliver “innovative products for the automotive and transportation industries such as real-time parking and traffic information and solutions that facilitate the safe testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles” (Inrix). The company offers a list of products and services that use IoT wireless and adaptable connectivity, such as the INRIX Traffic app that advises users when to travel through their city based on current traffic data. In a past project partnered with the Florida Department of Transportation, the company combined data from road network sensors, local transport authorities, fleet vehicle travel locations and consumer data from the INRIX Traffic App to identify bottlenecks that cause traffic congestion (Inrix). The resulting data reports collected throughout the state of Florida identified the top five bottlenecks within certain districts. The data was shared with district level and statewide organizations to optimize future road and traffic planning (Inrix). The company’s mission to ensure and enhance driving intelligence helps growing cities manage and protect their populations. The consumers and other organizations using the products of INRIX benefit through lasting change taken as a result of data collected. INRIX themselves ultimately benefits by creating a huge consumer base from applications and products being used, allowing their profits and reputation to increase for further business.<br>
<br>
Not only does the use of Internet of Things show promise within the automation industry, but it’s benefits also transcend into the field of healthcare. Through fast and reliable transfer of data from one system to another, IoT provides healthcare organizations a secure way to share healthcare information. Transmitting medical records and other healthcare information is a daily task for healthcare organizations, so making sure that data transmission is as secure as possible is a top priority. Especially during the modern health climate and the increase in coronavirus cases that has forced social distancing and seclusion into the norm, electronic healthcare has become a necessity for individuals in need. Even before the current healthcare crisis we currently face, healthcare has encountered strains on their system as populations steadily increase due to longer life expectancy among the elderly, low medical staff in rural towns and the potential dangers climate change has on children and the elderly (Thakar and Pandya). Hospital workers have become overworked and hospitals at times have reached their maximum capacity limits for patients. Fortunately, due to an increased need in remote accessibility, software and medical devices are already in development to solve these problems. 
In the study “Survey of IoT enables healthcare devices”, Anandi Thakar and Sharmil Pandya outline possibilities for remote monitoring systems for individuals in need. The possibilities include medical devices that check patient body temperatures and transmit data to healthcare providers. A “wearable heartbeat oximeter", named Wrist OX2, by Nonin currently uses this concept to monitor oxygen levels in elderly with sensors (Thakar and Pandya). An even more advanced technology through a “Dobbler radar approach” and IoT data transmission can monitor safety of elderly within their homes at all hours (Thakar and Pandya). Sensors and radar transmissions would be hooked up within the patient's home to keep track of their movements. The IoT-based system would make sure the elderly individual is safe from catastrophic falls and gauge speed of movement to recognize any out of the ordinary health behaviors. Patients using such IoT-based technologies and applications will be able to independently monitor their health and keep up to date with their electronic medical stats through medical notifications, medical resource sharing applications and “cross-availability conventions for heterogeneous gadgets” (Thakar and Pandya). In order for these devices to function they will need to be reliable, secure, long-lasting and easy to use. The interconnectedness of Internet of Things to handle and keep up with various medical needs and functions simultaneously helps solve accessibility and availability concerns for users and medical staff.<br>
<br>
The Thales Group, a multinational company that builds electrical systems for use in many fields, has already put these IoT features into mass use for medical providers. On their website, the company outlines benefits previously discussed as well as additional benefits of reduced global healthcare costs projected for 2022 with the deployment of advancing medical technologies using IoT (Thales Group). The company uses cellular transmission as opposed to Wi-Fi, using less bandwidth for a faster connection, to connect devices and send medical data to recipients (Thales Group). The company secures patient data through advanced ID authorization and data encryption with regular security updates so that patient confidentiality is kept (Thales Group). Through regular security and performance updates, these devices allow patients who regularly use them to obtain more independence over their health and wellness. In recent studies, the IoT healthcare market is expected to have a steady increase in growth by 2025 with these new advancements and developments in remote healthcare concepts and the deployment of medical devices (Grand View Research). A recent market report shows that hospitals and clinics held the “largest revenue share in 2018 due to increased investments by hospitals to encourage the usage of digital technologies” where North America is increasingly taking hold over the growing IT healthcare market (Grand View Research). Investors are paying attention to the future growth of IoT-based systems and taking part to help increase advancements. Through Thales Group’s technical developments, hospitals and medical facilities are able to maintain sufficient patient capacity limits, check on their patients remotely when needed and access patient data wherever and whenever. With an increase usage of such IoT products and devices by patients, the market can only continue to grow further helping the medical industry keep up with difficult times.<br>
<br>
There’s no doubt that the huge potential shown by current data and research done on Internet of Things and its many applications across various fields showcases the advantages it has for global populations. Objects and devices of the Internet can be used for simple implementations like in one’s watch or a stuffed animal, or it can be used for broader applications such as driver safety through automated vehicles or developing advanced healthcare services. Challenges will be met like any other information technology, such as privacy and security issues, but as long as a solid structured approach is created for handling such challenges then its benefits remain limitless.<br>

<h3 id="toc2">Tank Girl the Comic and Tank Girl the Film</h3>
<p>
In this essay I will be comparing and contrasting the original 1988-1990 Tank Girl British comics drawn by Jamie Hewlett and written by Alan Martin alongside the 1995 movie adaptation, Tank Girl by Rachel Talalay. Tank Girl One is the first installation of the remastered classic Tank Girl collection and contains Episode One through Episode Fifteen of the comic series (Hewlett and Martin). Tank Girl One will be the main frame of reference for this evaluation.<br>
<br>
From the very beginning, Tank Girl the comic holds no reservations nor practices much in terms of censorship. It is in your face, dirty, amoral, anti-intellectual, and raunchy - just like our main character and antihero Tank Girl. Jamie Hewlett draws Tank Girl in revealing clothing that is ripped, dirty, probably smelly, and just plain ugly when looking at it from society’s normalized standards of fashion and beauty. This isn’t exactly a book you would show your grandma or read to your kid at night. Just within the first episode of the series, there is reference to alcohol, a little too horny of kangaroos that murder and pillage as they see fit, even more violence, and of course - a natural progression - sex between characters. As the mutant kangaroos say, “This is what we want! Beer, bombs, and badness!” (Hewlett and Martin). Both in imagery and in text, this comic delivers a heavy dose of action, sex, and drugs.<br>
<br>
This is also represented in the language of the comic. Martin utilizes speech text bubbles to give each character their own voice, while also using text boxes for additional speech from the audience’s omnipresent narrator. It’s not entirely clear in this first book who the omnipresent narrator is, but there might be a slight hint in Episode Six to whom it may be. While Tank Girl is driving her tank across the desert, she stops in her tracks to appreciate a large painting on the side of a rockface. The artist comes out and they have a conversation where he tells her a story about a “great woman, a woman with big guns” that’s brave and bald, and continues to describe attributes that strongly resemble those of Tank Girl (Hewlett and Martin).<br>
<br>
Tank Girl and the rest of the characters are living in the post-apocalyptic outbacks of Australia, both in the comic and in the film. Although there is some resemblance of a governing body in place, there seems to be a lack of adherence to any laws or rules by Tank Girl and most of the characters she meets. In Episode Two of the comic, we see a short interaction between Tank Girl and the president, President Hogan. Tank Girl, being a part of the military system, has orders to deliver President Hogan a “consignment of colostomy bags” before he accidentally uses the bathroom on himself, to put it lightly (Hewlett and Martin). She runs into some conflict, fails the mission, and the President ultimately craps himself. In Episode Three we meet Farrow, a character who seems to have trained Tank Girl in some of her military training. Farrow’s description of Tank Girl sums up their relationship well: “I trained her, taught her everything she knows and still she has no respect for me…” (Hewlet and Martin). It’s probably also fair to say Tank Girl doesn’t respect much of anyone or anything, except for beer.<br>
<br>
We see Tank Girl go on many random adventures throughout the comics that don’t necessarily support a plot or storyline. In Episode Six, she gives the devil a magical gown called “God’s dressing gown”, which she found while fighting a character named Indiana, in exchange for three wishes. The film is structured similarly where it doesn’t follow a plot, but instead just follows Tank Girl and other characters of the comic’s universe across random encounters and conflicts. If there could be said to be a plot, it mostly centers around fighting the big bad Water and Power corporation (Talalay). Although the specific characters I’ve mentioned so far are not in the Tank Girl film, the cast and crew are composed entirely of characters from the comic book series.<br>
<br>
Although there’s not much to the plot, the comic still appears to carry a message that takes a stand against currently held mainstream beliefs and standards during the time of its release in the 1980’s. The comic was created in response to an era “devoid of taste”, as Alan Martin puts it (Hewlett and Martin). The audience of the original comic were folks who felt similarly that the media and entertainment during the time just wasn’t cutting it. They may have felt that it was time for a drastic shift from what was believed to be appropriate and entertaining for consumption.<br>
<br>
The character of Tank Girl can in a way be seen as an empowering figure for women during this time as well. Although Tank Girl doesn’t exactly treat herself with much respect while excessively drinking and having questionable sexual encounters with mutated kangaroos and other characters, the bottom line is it’s her choice and she chooses to go against the grain in a radical way. And it offers endless entertainment. The film represents similar views even though the film's association with a production company slightly takes away from the DIY indie counterculture ideals from the original comic. But the mutated kangaroos horrible production value kind of evens it out.<br>
<br>
The remastered version of the original comics is painted in black and white, although the original comics were printed in color. Because of this, we lose some detail that originally enhanced the world-building of the series. The film itself is in color and shows colorful snapshots from the original comics in the intro, similar to how Marvel Studios will have snapshots from Marvel comics in their opening credits. Doing so offers the audience a frame of reference to what they’re about to watch -- a specific comic to film adaptation.<br>
<br>
The film’s audience during the time of its release in 1995 probably closely resembled the audience of the comics during their release, who were mostly individuals interested in ideas outside of the mainstream. The comics were a “quick rise to fame [which] coincided with Riot Grrrl culture and music in the United States” (Kerns). The ironic popularity of the comics then gave rise to the creation of the film, which casted well known actors like Ice-T, Iggy Pop, Naomi Watts, Lori Petty, and more (Tank Girl). Both Tank Girl the comic and Tank Girl the film were successful in terms of their consumption by readers and viewers. People of the underground Riot Grrl culture at the time were circulating their own media and art, expressing their disdain for the currently held patriarchal systems in place within media, government, and society in general, both in the US and the UK.<br>
<br>
In regards to the value of both the Tank girl comic and Tank girl the film, it’s undeniable that both were timely in their release, where many subcultures were already present within the US and UK that were able to identify with both releases. This is of course representative of its success in a way, but it also enhances the value of the work because it had, and still has, a positive effect on consumers. Just the simple fact that there was recognition for the need for new media and new ideas represented in media, where individuals were then able to identify and feel empowered by the work, gives the work great value.<br>

<h3 id="toc3">Information Behavior of the Blind and Visually Impaired</h3>
<p>
<b>Section 1: Introduction of the User Population</b><br>
<br>
The user population that will be evaluated within this paper are blind and/or visually impaired information seekers. The information behavior seen within studies of this user group will be related to the information services and information technologies offered, specifically within academic library settings, for the population currently. While some of the studies weren’t always focused on academic settings, helpful data from these studies can still assist in understanding the relationship of visually impaired and the assistive services they require to perform their information seeking behaviors within settings like academic libraries. How services and technologies designed for this population, or lack therefore, shape the information behavior of visually impaired users is necessary to understand when creating a supportive and successful environment for these users. The studies are not limited to the United States, where users examined were sometimes in outside countries. The age range for the population are college students, young adults and older adults, which would be the age range most seen within an academic library setting.<br>
<br>
Many visually impaired individuals rely on specific technologies and information services to assist and complete their information seeking behavior tasks, such as finding jobs or performing research for coursework. One of the most important aspects in analyzing the information behavior of the visually impaired population is their personal review and feelings towards services offered and used. Without personal ethnographies of blind participants, an assistive service or technology cannot be truly successful until the needs professed by the user group are heard and addressed.<br>
<br>
<b>Section 2: Literature Review</b><br>
<br>
Within some studies that evaluated the visually impaired, at times blind professionals and mentors in related fields of research were used to assist the blind students while analyzing their information behavior (Antonelli, Steverson and O'Malley, 2018). This method is an observational style of study. Other styles of studies had direct and in depth interviews with legally blind or visually impaired individuals to ask them questions concerning accessibility (Xie, Babu, Lee, Castillo, You, and Hanlon,  2020). This approach allows researchers to fully understand and interpret the thoughts and emotions of this population of information seekers. A main theme for the studies relating to this topic is accessibility of information and accessibility for a marginalized group. The studies aim to understand the information behavior of the visually impaired, whether it be for academic research or seeking healthcare information (Beverley, Bath and Barber, R., 2007). Because blind individuals rely on information services and assistive technologies for their information behaviors, usability analysis and personal reviews of those services and technologies are imperative in forming services for them.<br>
<br>
Some errors in studies of the visually impaired are that most studies in the past were observational task based approaches. They seek to understand how visually impaired students make decisions and solve problems throughout their information seeking process by only observing users in real-time. A more personal method of understanding how the visually impaired make decisions would be a more beneficial and insightful approach to creating information services and technologies for the blind. More recent studies use the frameworks of everyday life information seeking (ELIS) and the sense-making approach (Tomlinson, 2016).<br>
<br>
<b>Section 2.1: Major Issues and Themes within Studies of the Visually Impaired</b><br>
<br>
Some major issues noted by studies within the information services and technologies meant for the visually impaired are the poor accessibility design of products and services, lack of quality assessment of information, and a lack of significant personal information concerning the information behavior of visually impaired folks. The most important issues affecting the information behavior of the visually impaired are that of accessibility which affects independence of mobility and limits access to quality information. Many visually impaired users, much like sighted users, are influenced by the technologies and services they are using. It not only affects the information absorbed but also how that information is interpreted.<br>
<br>
There are many assistive tools and services out there for low sighted individuals, such as software that enhances computer images for low sighted users to “ensure understanding and interpretations of images” (Estrada, 2016). Some systems are able to simplify images to provide low sighted people with a simple description of the imperative details of an image of background (Estrada, 2016). Laptops, smartphones and computers are extremely useful tools for low sighted and visually impaired people, like Apple’s iOS VoiceOver software that “vocalizes functions of the smartphone” (Estrada, 2016). Systems that utilizes text-to-speech software and other accessibility methods are essential in creating independence and mobility for the visually impaired, especially when performing research on the web.<br>
<br>
These tools and services are meant to be assistive in nature but still contain issues. For example, an observational study using a web camera to watch visually impaired users perform searches using text-to-speech applications on the web highlights the difference in web-baseds searches by the visually impaired versus that of sighted individuals. The visually impaired were observed viewing fewer pages of results and visited less external links than sighted searchers; they were also reported making less use of “advanced operators” as well as their “search engine’s query supported features” (R. Laval Hunsucker, 2013). The visually impaired users used less search engine features that could have assisted their research, and they retrieved less information than the sighted users. When they were made aware of the opportunities and features of search engines they could have used, the low sighted still did not make as much use out of them because of the amount of time and effort it would take to use such features (R. Laval Hunsucker, 2013). Visually impaired students performing research in another study by Nuzhah Gooda Sahib, Anastasios Tombros, and Tony Stockman noted a “lack of awareness and use of [query level support features] by visually impaired searchers” as well (Sahib, Tombros, and Stockman, 2012). This appears to be a common issue within the search process of the visually impaired.<br>
<br>
Many visually impaired information seekers may have changed their information behavior process if given better quality information products however, where most were already “unaware of search engine facilities or searching tactics which might have improved their search outcomes” (R. Laval Hunsucker, 2013). Even though they were made aware of advanced features after conducting their searches, the features were still not utilized by them. While this study highlights information behavior differences, it also shows that the information behavior of the visually impaired is shaped much by what is not known by them. This in itself demonstrates poor design-- a helpful and effective searching system would have already addressed this issue in its design. All of the search features should be made more apparent to users upfront and helpful features should not take significant cognitive effort that risks user energy and time constraints. The study conducted by R. Laval Hunsucker neglected to voice the personal responses of the users. It would have been helpful to ask directly what exactly would help the visually imparied perform research more efficiently and with less cognitive stress.<br>
<br>
In another study, Esther Mbugua, Professor Cephas Odini PhD, and Dr. Andrew Chege examines and analyzes the information seeking process for visually impaired college students in Kenya. This study was “informed by the Moore’s Model of Social Needs and Wilson’s Model of Information Behavior” and was conducted “using a case research”  (Mbugua, E.N., Odini, C., and Chege, A. 2018). The students in the study were observed performing experiments in science subjects. They experienced challenges such as difficulty navigating the environment, inadequate data collection within the experiment, lack of proper technology and inadequate finances and human resources to perform the experiments. These challenges mirror the previous study in that the behavior of the students and data collected for the study were labelled as inadequate or not sufficient due to lack of resources for them. The study shows how the students are “prone to powerlessness and inability to participate in decision making and development programmes that affect them and their fundamental rights” (Mbugua, E.N., Odini, C., and Chege, A. 2018). It was noted within the study that the support equipment was not supportive enough in the needs of the students, where the Braille machines were broken and not fit. Their information behavior may have been different if appropriate resources and adequate environments were provided to them. Again, within this experiment there was no mention of personal responses or stories heard from the visually impaired.<br>
<br>
Another challenge that the visually impaired face is information quality assessment (Stvilia, 2007). Researcher Besiki Stvilia highlights this issue by introducing an information quality framework. She describes information quality as the “degree of usefulness” or the “fitness of use” within a specific context (Stvilia, 2007). People that rely on assistive technologies for research are at the risk of running into more unrelated and useless information. This poses an issue because it increases the cognitive stress and labor involved in meeting their information needs. The visually impaired can’t see what they aren’t able to, so it’s up to others to make sure they are getting the same quality of information and services as sighted people.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, much of the challenges within studies of the visually impaired’s information behavior are a lack of library programs, insufficient materials for the visually impaired, lack of funds, lack of supportive technology and inadequate personnel. These challenges directly affect the information behavior of these users, the success of their information behavior, as well as their independence. Common themes within these studies are that the studies used observational methods, the visually impaired were often not given adequate services, and many of the decisions made by the visually impaired were influenced by the assistive technologies used. All studies sought to understand the information needs of the population.<br>
<br>
<b>Section 2.2 Research Questions Answered</b><br>
<br>
Many questions have been answered by studies of the information behavior of the visually impaired. Questions such as “What are the information needs of the visually impaired in specific settings?” For the study conducted by Esther Mbugua, Professor Cephas Odini PhD, and Dr. Andrew Chege, they were able to evaluate the needs of the visually impaired students within the school in Kenya. The needs were identified as accessible mobility software and services like assistive technology on computers, Braille and communication devices such as slate and stylus, tape recorder, typewriters and computer (Mbugua, E.N., Odini, C., and Chege, A. 2018). Like this study, it’s apparent that the visually impaired rely heavily on communication and visual aids to assist in their information behavior. Acknowledgement from the students of the importance of the library for services was noted despite the small size of the library space and the lack of adequate assistive equipment (Mbugua, E.N., Odini, C., and Chege, A. 2018). The services that the library can provide is important for information access and completion of information behavior, which also addresses the next question answered through information behavior studies.<br>
<br>
How do the visually impaired access information? The utilization of the library and library services was popular in information behavior studies. The visually impaired are seen using the internet, assistive technologies and softwares for research, and the assistance of library personnel. In one study, the visually impaired often relied heavily on interpersonal relationships as well to assist in academic research (Šehić, S., and Tanacković, S. F. 2014). Using information that was given to them by a friend, coworker or family member was seen in the information seeking behavior of another group of visually impaired in a study observing how the visually impaired sought healthcare information (Beverley, Bath, and Barber, 2007). Much of the information they knew and the places known where to seek new information was shown or explained to them by others. Not only are assistive technologies helpful but also the communication and information that is given through interpersonal relationships. Creating appropriate personnel and services are just as important in increasing the wellbeing of the visually impaired.<br>
<br>
One of the key components in creating services and resources for users is usability and accessibility testing. A study by Shannon Tomlinson analyzes web accessibility for blind and low sighted people. It provides a conceptual framework that informed the study of models discussed in our course readings such as the Everyday Life Information Seeking Model by Savolainen and Dervin’s Sense-Making Theory (Tomlinson, 2016). Using these familiar and relevant theories enhances the understanding of information behavior and needs of the users and provides further answers to important questions about the information needs of the visually impaired. The answers this study provides to blind people’s user experience offers important insight for the development of information services for these users (Tomlinson, 2016). The web is a powerful and empowering tool for the visually impaired. Studying ways to make the web more accessible for them can drastically improve their lives.<br>
<br>
When first creating products and services for this population’s information needs, you must first understand the difference in the information seeking process of low sighted individuals versus sighted individuals. Researchers Nuzhah Gooda Sahib, Anastasios Tombros, and Tony Stockman conducted a study that examined the difference between the two population’s information seeking behavior. Within this study, they observed sighted and visually impaired students searching on the web. The search tasks are aimed to satisfy their information needs. The researchers observed the visually impaired students had an increasing “dependency on the web for their information-seeking activities”, where screen readers and navigational support devices were extremely popular (Sahib, Tombros, and Stockman, 2012). They labeled various stages of the information seeking process of the students: query formulation, search results exploration, query reformulation, and search results management (Sahib, Tombros, and Stockman, 2012). The information seeking process is affected by the complexity of the task which is due to many factors. The study answered the question of what strategies the visually impaired use when formulating queries, where they were observed submitting long queries representing the “complete information need in an attempt to find what they were looking for in one step” (Sahib, Tombros, and Stockman, 2012). It’s common to see the visually impaired employ strategies that may reduce their cognitive load early on. The study highlighted another point made early on that the visually impaired remain unaware of search support features that could have assisted their search processes. This further shows how important it is to update the usability and accessibility of your software and services.<br>
<br>
<b>Section 3: A Personal Research Study</b><br>
<br>
Based on the methods used in past studies of the information behavior of the visually impaired, there are a few things that I would do differently in a personal research study of this population. I would model my study around Kuhlthau’s Information Seeking Process (ISP) Model that focuses on a user’s information seeking process. In her series of five studies conducted in field situations with actual library users, she asked participants to perform research and fill out a personal questionnaire. She notes specifically the feelings of the users throughout their information seeking process, where their emotions transition from uncertainty, confusion, confidence to relief (Kuhlthau C.C. 1991). Through her studies she was able to create a model consisting of six stages of the information seeking process. A study similar to this would be beneficial to analyzing the information seeking process of visually impaired users so as to create and host better services and products for them. The visually impaired can be given a research task using the assistive software that they require and interviewed on what worked for their search process and what didn’t. Labeling and identifying the emotions and feelings felt throughout their information seeking process helps to further understand what aspects of services and products are truly assistive. Libraries and library workers have a direct responsibility to assist blind individuals in their information seeking process. This is especially true for academic libraries as they are tasked with this job for their community and students.<br>
