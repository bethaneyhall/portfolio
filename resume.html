    <h4>University of Alabama at Birmingham Libraries</h4><h4><i>Electronic Access & Discovery Librarian</i></h4>
      <h4>June 2022 - PRESENT<br>Birmingham, AL</h4>
      </div>

   <p>In my current role at UAB Libraries, I provide technical support to a diverse user base across five campus library locations, including medical and historical libraries. I serve as a key resource for addressing user needs and ensuring seamless access to electronic resources, digital tools and online services critical to academic and research success. I'm responsible for implementing, maintaining, and enhancing a wide array of library technologies and systems. These include Alma, Primo VE, OCLC WMS, EZproxy, OneSearch, LibKey, Shibboleth, Digital Commons, Library Mobile, Elastic, Unity Alliance Program, WinSCP, and SpringShare LibApps.</p>

<p>I apply metadata standards such as MARC, Dublin Core (DC), LCSH, and MeSH, along with tools like EZproxy, OpenURL mapping, parse parameter linking, 2FA, LibKey, and Shibboleth to ensure reliable, secure, and accurate access to electronic and digital resources. To promote system and platform literacy, I create instructional materials and facilitate workshops for staff and faculty. I utilize tools such as Zoom, Teams, Kaltura, Canva, LucidChart, LibApps, Word, Adobe Firefly, Adobe Express, Google Slides, and PowerPoint to deliver effective training and documentation.</p>

<p>Another aspect of my role involves collecting resource usage analytics across internal systems and vendor platforms. I use tools such as Oracle, vendor platforms (SUSHI, COUNTER5 harvesting), Tableau, Google Analytics, and Excel. These insights help inform decision-making and improve user experience. I also utilize my knowledge of Bootstrap 5, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and AngularJS to enhance the functionality and accessibility of Primo VE and LibGuides. I ensure that all enhancements comply with ADA accessibility standards to support an inclusive user environment.</p>

<p>My work aligns closely with the strategic goals and service mission of the university and library. I contribute to digital collections and facilitate resource sharing through collaborative efforts with peer institutions, including participation in initiatives such as the Digital Library of the Middle East (DLME).</p>

    <h4><i>Electronic Resources Library Associate</i></h4>
    <h4>June 2019 - June 2022<br>Tallahassee, FL</h4>
      </div>
      
      <p>At FSU Libraries, I led the implementation and customization of the institution’s CORAL Electronic Resource Management System (ERMS), building out key modules such as Licensing, Organizations, Usage Data, Resources, and Management. I developed workflows and best practices for using CORAL, enhancing coordination in vendor relationships, licensing, and access. I also created documentation and workflows for managing and maintaining e-resource collections in EBSCOadmin.</p>
      
      <p>My role involved extensive collaboration with FSU’s global library network including consortium partners, vendors, and publishers, while providing ongoing support and troubleshooting to ensure uninterrupted access to databases, journals, e-books, and digital media. This required me to apply technical expertise in EZproxy, OpenURL mapping, parse parameter linking, and metadata standards. To support evidence-based collection development, I regularly collected and analyzed usage statistics from multiple vendor platforms and the library's internal systems.</p>
      
      <p> I contributed to the Libraries’ UX/UI committee to promote user-centered design for the website and discovery systems using Google Analytics, Drupal 9, Morae, LucidChart, LibSites, and OptimalWorkshop.</p>

    <h4><i>Information Specialist III</i></h4>
    <h4>October 2018 - June 2019<br>Tallahassee, FL</h4>
      </div>
 
      <p>At the State Library of Florida, I managed the electronic delivery service of library resources exclusively for State employees, coordinating digital access requests to ensure timely, reliable support for government operations and research needs. I also assisted with reviewing and renewing annual serial subscription contracts by evaluating usage trends and vendor terms to support cost-effective collection development.</p>

      <p>In addition to these responsibilities, I provided daily in-person and online reference services, helping patrons navigate resources and databases to find accurate information. I contributed to digitization efforts by uploading heavily used serials and periodicals to the State Library catalog and the Internet Archive, improving long-term accessibility and preservation of important government and public records.</p>

      <p>In this public service role, I provided daily in-person reference assistance, helping patrons locate materials, navigate collections, and answer research questions. I also trained users on specialized equipment like microfilm and microfiche scanners and supported them with computer applications and library software to facilitate their research and document needs.</p>

    <p>Beyond direct patron support, I volunteered for library events and presentations to enhance community engagement and promote library services. Additionally, I managed the check-in and check-out of physical inter-library loan materials and collected usage data to support internal reporting and resource planning.</p>

      <p>During my time in this role, I created and instructed a weekly poetry workshop for K-12 students that attended the teen center after standard school hours. I also created a WorkPress site that featured a blog of activites and events, a schedule of events, and blurbs from students at the center. While I wasn't running the workshop, I spent time assisting students in English and Literature homework, and assisted with daily center activities.</p>
